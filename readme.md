First version of ColorTracking
 
This program is a working progress, it detects whatever color you set in the code and follows it around the screen frame by frame. This algorithm is very reliable.

Im working in a second version in which it will follow whatever color you click on instead of one predertemined color. I'll keep posting updates so stay tune
